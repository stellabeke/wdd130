            <p> Enugu (Igbo: á»ŒÌ€hÃ  Enugu) verbally pronounced as "Ená»¥gwá»¥" by the Igbo indigenes is a state in the South-East geopolitical
            zone of Nigeria, bordered to the north by the states of Benue and Kogi, Ebonyi State to the east and southeast, Abia
            State to the south, and Anambra State to the west. The state takes its name from its capital and largest city, Enugu.
            The city acquired township status in 1917 and was called Enugwu-Ngwo. Due to the rapid expansion towards areas owned by
            other indigenous communities, it was renamed Enugu in 1928.
            Of the 36 states, Enugu is the 29th largest in area and 22nd most populous with an estimated population of over 4.4
            million as of 2016</p>
